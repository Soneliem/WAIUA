# Localization
WAIUA has full localization support and any number of languages can be added and changed natively. By default the app changes it's language based on the user's system language.

### Guidelines/Tips for adding Translations:
- Only add translations for things that you are 100% sure on. Partially translating files is ok as long as you put in some effort
- One of the keys named: "Translator" has an English translation of:
`Translated into English By Soneliem`
Change this to:
`Translated into [language-you-are-translating-to] By [your-name/username]`
If there is already a name there, simply add your's to the end.
- Please try to only add generic languages such as English(en) rather than English-United States(en-US)
