# Localization
WAIUA has full localization support and any number of languages can be added and changed natively. By default, the app changes its language based on the user's system language.

### Guidelines/Tips for adding Translations:
- Only add translations for things that you are 100% sure on. Partially translating files is ok as long as you put in some effort
- One of the keys is named: "Translator" and has an English translation of:
`Translated into English By Soneliem`
Change this to:
`Translated into [language-you-are-translating-to] By [your-name/username]`
If there is already a name there, simply add yours to the end.
- Please try to only add generic languages such as English(en) rather than English-United States(en-US)

## How to Contribute using [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=eDxQpoYC9q)
POEditor lets people collaboratively edit translations, supports auto-translations, quality checks, etc. It's very easy to use and lets me monitor/help people.

- Select the languages you want to help translate and press "Join Translation"
  - If it re-directs you to the home page click on "WAIUA"
  - You can add another language by requesting it (It automatically accepts)
- The first column is the English reference with the second column being what you can edit
  - You can change English to another language with the "Set Reference Language" button towards the top right
- Changes are auto saved
- After being proof-read, your changes will be pushed to the GitHub repo and included in the next release
