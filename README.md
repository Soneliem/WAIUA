## Getting Started

To get the app up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Windows 64-bit (If you're able to run Valorant on it you'll be fine)
* .NET (will be automatically installed during installation)

### Installation

1. Download [the latest installer](https://github.com/Soneliem/WAIUA/releases/latest/download/WAIUA.exe)
2. Run the .exe (If a blue box saying "Windows protected your PC" shows up, click `More Info` and then `Run Anyway`)
3. Follow the steps to install WAIUA

## Usage

1. Open the app
2. WAIUA will automatically check for new matches or wait for a match like a good boi
3. Win games (unless you find out you're playing against a smurf. In that case RIP your RR)

## Roadmap and Known Bugs

Please check the [issues tab](https://github.com/Soneliem/WAIUA/issues) before making a new issue. My [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/X7CYCeZSRK) has a list of known bugs and upcoming features.

## Built With
* [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/?view=netdesktop-6.0)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

I knew none of these things before making this lol

#### Packages that I used/ recommend:
* [RestSharp](https://restsharp.dev/) for API requests
* [System.Text.Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json) to deserialise JSON. Source generators are a Godsend
* [Windows Community Toolkit MVVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/mvvm/introduction) for MVVM. Ty for Source Generators too
* [AutoUpdater.NET](https://github.com/ravibpatel/AutoUpdater.NET) for auto updates
* [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to install WAIUA
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/license) for icons. I'm also supposed say that I changed the colours so here it is


## Why I Made This

The main reason I made this was to detect smurfs. This app basically settles the debates between team members or the enemy. The set of available features was chosen carefully to maintain the competitive integrity of the game. Many suggestions that I get are declined due to this (unless a certain "competing" verified app implements it). 

Another reason to making this was that I wanted some experience with .NET and GUI apps. This application uses C# as the backend, WPF as the frontend and .NET as the framework. I knew none of these when I began, so this was a fun journey. I've gained alot of experice of how to and how not to (mostly the latter) use WPF and C#.
